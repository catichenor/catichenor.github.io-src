<p>If you don’t do vegetables, do your drugs, and eat your algorithms, you can be big and strong like me!</p>
<h1>Fr1st P0st</h1>
<p>Yes, this dates me as an olde time Slashdot user. Buck feta!</p>
<p>I’m writing this before I’ve even registered my domain because I want everything <em>about</em> this site chronicled <em>in</em> the site. I’ll get to my mission statement in the next post.</p>
<p>Apologies for the stream-of-consciousness nature of the prose here.</p>
<h2>Domain Registrar</h2>
<p>First order of business is to pick a domain registrar... time to start Googling. Hm, a couple of hits, a fair amount of what looks like sponsored posts... GoDaddy is fairly low-ranked which is a good sign... <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/go/namecheap">NameCheap</a> and <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/go/bluehost">BlueHost</a> might work? Providers may be gaming the algorithm, DuckDuckGo to the rescue! </p>
<p>Ech, a few articles from 2010 and 2012... </p>
<p>Ooh, <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/reviews/domain-registrars/">this is a nice article</a>.</p>
<p>Looks like NameCheap it is. I'll follow up if they screw me over.</p>
<h2>Site Architecture</h2>
<p>Next is how to actually implement the site. I don't really care for comments, my Wordpress site from 6-7 years ago had its comments system overrun by Russian hackers, which I blocked by disabling the comments section and removing them from the stylesheet, so I'd rather just not have them altogether. </p>
<p>A static site generator looks to be the right tool here, and I could probably leverage GitHub for hosting. Jekyll is the obvious choice, except that it'd require that I learn Ruby for modifications and Ruby is... meh. Unless you're looking to hire me, in which case, I <em>love</em> Ruby!</p>
<p>Off to <a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#static-site-generator">Awesome Python</a>... quite a few options here, looks like <a href="https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus">Cactus</a> runs on Django, also meh... <a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde">Hyde</a> (I see what they did there) looks promising, but hasn't been updated in about two years. <a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola">Nikola</a> seems like a strong contender, last update was a few hours ago, might be a bit heavyweight, though... <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a> looks like a contender. <a href="https://github.com/vladris/tinkerer/">Tinkerer</a> doesn't really look compatible with my knowledge base.</p>
<p>So... Nikola or Pelican. Both seem to have pretty <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/">decent</a> <a href="http://journalpanic.com/pyhi/posts/make-your-own-blog-with-github-pages-and-nikola/">tutorials</a>. Nikola looks to have a direct CLI for GitHub pages, which is nice, but also still looks fairly complicated. I think I'll go with Pelican for now, looks like it should be fairly easy to switch out if something doesn't pan out.</p>
<h2>Building the Site</h2>
<p>Time to make a <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, um, page? Go through the tutorial, la la la... okay done, go to the site... not working? Try again a minute later... now it works. "Hello World" indeed.</p>
<p>Okay now to set up Pelican. Hm, instructions also want me to make a <code>[username].github.io-src</code> repo, okay, done... now it wants me to install the Python Pelican package? I'm not on Fedora so, no. I should probably pip install in a virtualenv... all the tutorials say to have a dedicated Pelican virtualenv? That doesn't sound right, but whatever. </p>
<p>Alright, looks like I should probably use this sequence:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python3 -m venv Pelican
<span class="nb">cd</span> Pelican
<span class="nb">source</span> bin/activate
</pre></div>


<p>Okay, now we're in our virtualenv. Now to install Pelican and a few dependencies:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip3 install pelican
pip3 install Markdown typogrify
</pre></div>


<p>Okay, now we have our packages, time to set up the site. Doesn't seem right to do it here, maybe I can go back to the other directory?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> ../catichenor.github.io-src
</pre></div>


<p>The next step, which I assume to be <code>git submodule add git@github.com:catichenor/catichenor.github.io.git output</code> from the tutorial, doesn't work. Eh, maybe just skip straight to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pelican-quickstart
</pre></div>


<p>Okay done.</p>
<p>Now to write up a post based on the example from the docs:</p>

<p>This is a test. This is only a test.</p>

<p>Make and test the site... wow that's ugly. Okay, at least let me change the post to this one I'm typing, I can update it later.</p>                </article>
